  <div class="description">
    <p class="english">The <code>digraph_utils</code> module implements some algorithms
      based on depth-first traversal of directed graphs. See the
      <code>digraph</code> module for basic functions on directed graphs.
      </p>
    <p><code>digraph_utils</code> 模块实现了一些基于有向图深度优先遍历的算法. 参阅 <code>digraph</code> 模块中有向图的基本函数.

    <p class="english">A <marker id="digraph"></marker><em>directed graph</em> (or 
       just "digraph") is a pair (V,&nbsp;E) of a finite set V of
       <marker id="vertex"></marker><em>vertices</em> and a finite set E 
       of <marker id="edge"></marker><em>directed edges</em> (or just 
       "edges"). The set of edges E is a subset of V&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;V 
       (the Cartesian product of V with itself).
      </p>
    <p> <marker id="digraph"></marker><em>有向图</em> (简写"digraph") 是由一个<marker id="vertex"></marker><em>顶点</em>的有限集合 V 和一个<marker id="edge"></marker><em>有向边</em> (或者简写"edges")的有限集合E构成的对(V,&nbsp;E). 边集合E是V&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;V (V与本身的笛卡尔积)的一个子集.
      </p>
    <p class="english">Digraphs can be annotated with additional information. Such
      information may be attached to the vertices and to the edges of
      the digraph. A digraph which has been annotated is called a
      <em>labeled digraph</em>, and the information attached to a
      vertex or an edge is called a <marker id="label"></marker><em>label</em>.</p>
    <p>有向图可以用附加信息作为注释. 这些信息可以附加在图的顶点和边上. 一个带有注释的图称为<em>标记图</em>, 附加在一个顶点或者边上的信息称为<marker id="label"></marker> <em>标记</em>.</p>
    <p class="english">An edge e&nbsp;=&nbsp;(v,&nbsp;w) is said 
      to <marker id="emanate"></marker><em>emanate</em> from vertex v and 
      to be <marker id="incident"></marker><em>incident</em> on vertex w. 
      If there is an edge emanating from v and incident on w, then w is 
      said to be 
      an <marker id="out_neighbour"></marker><em>out-neighbour</em> of v, 
      and v is said to be 
      an <marker id="in_neighbour"></marker><em>in-neighbour</em> of w. 
      A <marker id="path"></marker><em>path</em> P from v[1] to v[k] in a 
      digraph (V,&nbsp;E) is a non-empty sequence
      v[1],&nbsp;v[2],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;v[k] of vertices in V such that
      there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for
      1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;k. 
      The <marker id="length"></marker><em>length</em> of the path P is k-1. 
      P is a <marker id="cycle"></marker><em>cycle</em> if the length of P 
      is not zero and v[1] = v[k]. 
      A <marker id="loop"></marker><em>loop</em> is a cycle of length one. 
      An <marker id="acyclic_digraph"></marker><em>acyclic digraph</em> is 
      a digraph that has no cycles.
      </p>
    <p>一条边e&nbsp;=&nbsp;(v,&nbsp;w) 表示从顶点v<marker id="emanate"></marker><em>发出</em> 并且 <marker id="incident"></marker><em>传入</em> 到顶点w. 如果存在一条从v发出并传入到w的边, 那么称w是v的一个<marker id="out_neighbour"></marker><em>外邻点</em>, 并且称v是w的一个<marker id="in_neighbour"></marker><em>内邻点</em>. 
      A <marker id="path"></marker><em>路径</em> P from v[1] to v[k] in a 
      digraph (V,&nbsp;E) is a non-empty sequence
      v[1],&nbsp;v[2],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;v[k] of vertices in V such that
      there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for
      1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;k. 
      路径P的<marker id="length"></marker><em>长度</em>是k-1. 
      如果P的长度不为零且v[1] = v[k], 那么P是一个<marker id="cycle"></marker><em>环</em>. 
      <marker id="loop"></marker><em>自环</em>是长度为1的环. 
      <marker id="acyclic_digraph"></marker><em>无环图</em> 是没有环的有向图.
      </p>
    <p class="english">A <marker id="depth_first_traversal"></marker> <em>depth-first
      traversal</em> of a directed digraph can be viewed as a process
      that visits all vertices of the digraph. Initially, all vertices
      are marked as unvisited. The traversal starts with an
      arbitrarily chosen vertex, which is marked as visited, and
      follows an edge to an unmarked vertex, marking that vertex. The
      search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until
      there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex. At that point
      the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as
      there are unexamined edges. If there remain unvisited vertices
      when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some
      hitherto unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is
      repeated.
      </p>
    <p>有向图的<marker id="depth_first_traversal"></marker><em>深度优先遍历</em>可以看作是一个访问有向图所有顶点的过程. 首先, 所有顶点都被标注为未访问. 遍历从一个任意选择的顶点(标注为以访问)开始, 并且通过一条边至一个未访问的顶点, marking that vertex. The
      search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until
      there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex. At that point
      the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as
      there are unexamined edges. If there remain unvisited vertices
      when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some
      hitherto unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is
      repeated.

    <p class="english">A <marker id="partial_ordering"></marker><em>partial ordering</em> of 
      a set S is a transitive, antisymmetric and reflexive relation
      between the objects of S. The problem 
      of <marker id="topsort"></marker><em>topological sorting</em> is to 
      find a total
      ordering of S that is a superset of the partial ordering. A
      digraph G&nbsp;=&nbsp;(V,&nbsp;E) is equivalent to a relation E
      on V (we neglect the fact that the version of directed graphs
      implemented in the <code>digraph</code> module allows multiple edges
      between vertices). If the digraph has no cycles of length two or
      more, then the reflexive and transitive closure of E is a
      partial ordering.
